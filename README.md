# Neural_network_FFBP
Neural Network class function with feed forward and back propagation

The code section holds code for neural network class in FFNB file. It can create a feedback neural network model with only one hidden layer. The no of nodes on the input layer, hidden layer, output layer are configurable. Both hidden and output layer has sigmoid activation functions.

The data processing file handles and process data for neural network training.
